# What is AI?
The science of making machines that act rationally, in order to maximize the expected utility
# Search Problems
- Act as an abstraction to solve real world problems. Real world problems contain a start state and a goal state. 
- By solving the search problem, we generate a sequence of actions/plan which transforms the start state to a goal state.

## UCS (Uniform Cost Search)
**Dijkstra's Algorithm** is a special case of **Uniform Cost Search**  
*UCS* is more general and is used to find the least-cost path to a specific goal node, *without necessarily exploring the entire graph.* However, Dijkstra finds the shortest path to all nodes, thus a more broader version of UCS.
Time complexity: $O(b^{C*/\epsilon})$
Space complexity: $O(b^{C*/\epsilon})$
- b is the branching factor of the graph (the average number of successors per state), 
- $C^*$ is the cost of the optimal solution, and ϵ is the smallest cost of any edge in the graph.
- $\epsilon$ is the smallest cost of any edge in the graph

# Search Heuristics 
- A function that *estimates* how close a state is to a goal 
- Designed for a particular search problem. Examples: Manhatten distance, Euclidean distance etc 
### Properties of Heuristic Functions: 
1. Admissibility 
2. Consistency 

Admissibility is about always being optimistic and never overestimating the cost. Consistency ensures that as you make progress, your heuristic doesn't suddenly give you a larger estimate than before.

#### Admissible Heuristic: 
- **Definition:** A heuristic is admissible if it never overestimates(≤) the cost of reaching the goal. 
- **Simple Explanation:** Think of the heuristic as a GPS system estimating the time to reach your destination. If the GPS always tells you the shortest possible time, without considering traffic or other delays, then it's being "optimistic" or admissible. It might take you longer in reality, but the GPS's estimate will never be longer than the actual time. 
- **Example:** Scenario: You're trying to find the shortest path from your house to a park in a city grid. Heuristic: Straight-line distance (as the crow flies) from your current location to the park. *Why it's Admissible:* The straight-line distance is the shortest possible distance between two points. Even though you can't walk through buildings and have to follow roads, the heuristic never overestimates the walking distance.

#### Consistent Heuristic: 
- **Definition:** A heuristic is consistent if the cost from the current state to a successor state, plus the estimated cost from the successor state to the goal, is always less than or equal to the estimated cost from the current state to the goal. 
- **Simple Explanation:** Imagine you're on a road trip, and you have multiple stops to make before reaching your final destination. *If at each stop, the estimated time to the final destination decreases or stays the same (because you're getting closer), then the heuristic is consistent.* 
- **Example:** Scenario: You're playing a game where you move a piece from the bottom of a board to the top, and you can move one step at a time. Heuristic: Number of steps from the current position to the top. *Why it's Consistent:* Each time you move up, you're one step closer to the top. So, the estimated steps to the goal will always decrease by one, ensuring the heuristic is consistent. 

# A* Search
- UCS+Greedy
- UCS orders by path cost (backward) g(n)
- Greedy orders by goal proximity (forward cost) h(n)
- A* combines and orders by the sum: g(n)+h(n)

A* is designed to find the shortest path to a goal. When the algorithm first encounters the goal node, it may not have explored all possible paths to that node. There could be a shorter or more efficient path that hasn't been considered yet. By continuing the search until the goal node is dequeued, A* ensures that it has considered all possible paths that could lead to a more optimal solution.
