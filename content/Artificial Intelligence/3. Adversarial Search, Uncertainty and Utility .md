Adversarial search is a type of search in artificial intelligence (AI) used to make optimal decisions in competitive environments, such as games, where multiple agents or players are competing against each other. This type of search assumes that one player’s gain is another player’s loss, which is common in zero-sum games like chess, checkers, and tic-tac-toe.

### 1. **Minimax Algorithm:**
The minimax algorithm is a fundamental method in adversarial search. It is used to determine the best move for a player assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.
### 2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning:**
Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the search tree, making the algorithm more efficient.

- **How It Works:**
  - As the minimax algorithm explores the tree, it keeps track of two values:
    - **Alpha (α):** The best value that the maximizing player can guarantee so far.
    - **Beta (β):** The best value that the minimizing player can guarantee so far.
  - During the search, if the algorithm finds a move that leads to a value worse than the current alpha or beta, it can stop evaluating that branch further, because no matter what moves are made, that branch will not affect the final decision.
  - This process of cutting off unnecessary branches is called "pruning."

- **Benefits:**
  - Alpha-beta pruning significantly reduces the number of nodes evaluated, allowing deeper exploration of the game tree within the same computational resources.
  - In the best case, alpha-beta pruning can reduce the time complexity from \($O(b^d)$\) to \($O(b^{d/2}$)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the tree.
