##### Features of K-means 
**Strength:** 
- Efficient: $O(tkn)$, where, n is # objects, k is # clusters, and t is # iterations. Normally, k, $t<n$
- Simplicity and ease of implementation
- Scalability 
**Weakness:** 
- Applicable only to objects in a continuous n-dimensional space 
- Initialization sensitivity 
- *Sensitive to noisy data and outliers*, an object with an extremely large value may substantially distort the distribution of the data 
- Not suitable to discover clusters with non-convex shapes. It Assumes spherical clusters with similar sizes: This can lead to poor results when the true clusters have different shapes, densities, or sizes. 
### K-medoids
- Select k points as the initial representative objects
- Repeat:
	- Assign each point to the closest medoid
	- Compute the total cost S of swapping the medoid m with a randomly selected object oi
	- If cost is less than 0, perform swap
