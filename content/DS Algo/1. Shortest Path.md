# BFS DFS
### BFS
```python
BFS(Graph, start_vertex):
    # Initialize an empty queue and a visited set
    queue = empty queue
    visited = empty set

    # Enqueue the start vertex and mark it as visited
    enqueue(queue, start_vertex)
    add start_vertex to visited

    # While the queue is not empty
    while queue is not empty:
        # Dequeue the front vertex from the queue
        current_vertex = dequeue(queue)
        
        # Process the current vertex (e.g., print it, perform an action)
        process(current_vertex)
        
        # Get all adjacent vertices of the current vertex
        for each neighbor in Graph.adjacent_vertices(current_vertex):
            if neighbor is not in visited:
                # Enqueue the neighbor and mark it as visited
                enqueue(queue, neighbor)
                add neighbor to visited
```

### DFS
```python
DFS(Graph, start_vertex):
    # Initialize an empty stack and a visited set
    stack = empty stack
    visited = empty set

    # Push the start vertex onto the stack
    push(stack, start_vertex)

    # While the stack is not empty
    while stack is not empty:
        # Pop the top vertex from the stack
        current_vertex = pop(stack)
        
        if current_vertex is not in visited:
            # Mark the vertex as visited
            add current_vertex to visited
            
            # Process the current vertex (e.g., print/perform an action)
            process(current_vertex)
            
            # Get all adjacent vertices of the current vertex
            for each neighbor in Graph.adjacent_vertices(current_vertex):
                if neighbor is not in visited:
                    # Push the neighbor onto the stack
                    push(stack, neighbor)
```
#### 1. Time Complexity Analysis
Both BFS and DFS have the same time complexity of \( O(V + E) \), where:
- V is the number of vertices (or nodes).
- E is the number of edges.

**Time Complexity Intuition**:
- **BFS** and **DFS** both traverse each vertex and edge once. Hence, in terms of time complexity, neither algorithm is inherently faster than the other. 
- The time complexity alone doesnâ€™t give an edge to either BFS or DFS, so the choice between them doesn't hinge on time complexity.

#### 2. Space Complexity Analysis

#### **BFS Space Complexity:**
- **Worst-case space complexity:** \( O(V) \).
- **Explanation:** BFS uses a queue to store nodes at the current level while exploring them. In the worst case, all nodes at a level can be stored in the queue simultaneously.

#### **DFS Space Complexity:**
- **Recursive DFS space complexity:** \( O(H) \), where \( H \) is the height or depth of the graph.
- **Iterative DFS space complexity:** \( O(V) \).
- **Explanation:** DFS uses a stack, which can be implemented either explicitly (in iterative DFS) or implicitly through the call stack (in recursive DFS). The maximum space needed is the height of the recursion stack, which is proportional to the depth of the graph.

#### Mathematical Analysis with Examples

##### Scenario 1: Wide and Shallow Graph -> DFS
Consider a graph where:
- The graph has many vertices \( V \), but it is shallow, i.e., the depth \( H \) is small (e.g., $H \ll V )$

**BFS**:
- Space Complexity: In the worst case, the queue could contain all \( V \) vertices at the widest level.
- BFS space complexity: \( O(V) \).

**DFS**:
- Space Complexity: DFS might require only $O(H)$ space, where $H$ is much smaller than $V$.
- DFS space complexity: $O(H)$

**Conclusion**:
- In a wide and shallow graph, **DFS** is better in terms of space because \( H \) is much smaller than \( V \). For example, in a binary tree of depth \( $H = 2$ \) and \( $V = 2^H - 1$ \), DFS would only need space proportional to \( H \) (i.e., 2), while BFS might require space proportional to \( V \) (i.e., 7).

##### Scenario 2: Deep and Narrow Graph
Consider a graph where:
- The graph is deep, meaning \( H \) is large, but narrow, meaning few nodes at each level.

**BFS**:
- Space Complexity: The queue in BFS still requires \( O(V) \) space, but since the graph is narrow, this space might not be as significant.
- BFS space complexity: \( O(V) \).

**DFS**:
- Space Complexity: In a deep graph, \( H \) could be as large as \( V \), so DFS may require \( O(H) = O(V) \) space in the worst case.
- DFS space complexity: \( O(H) = O(V) \).

**Conclusion**:
- In a deep and narrow graph, both **BFS** and **DFS** could have similar space complexity, especially if the depth \( H \) approaches \( V \). However, **DFS** might be more memory-efficient for very narrow graphs with smaller stacks.

### **Performance Differences in Special Cases**

#### **BFS vs. DFS for Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs**
Consider an unweighted graph where you need to find the shortest path from node \( A \) to node \( B \):
- **BFS** will explore all nodes at the present level before moving to the next, ensuring that the first time it reaches node \( B \), it has found the shortest path.
- **DFS** might explore a deep path that doesn't lead directly to \( B \) and thus might not find the shortest path until later.

**Conclusion**: **BFS** is better for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs because it guarantees the shortest path by level-wise exploration.

#### **DFS in Backtracking and Pathfinding**
Consider a problem like solving a maze or puzzle:
- **DFS** is better because it explores deep paths fully before backtracking, making it ideal for backtracking problems.

**Conclusion**: **DFS** is better for problems requiring exploration of all possible paths, such as backtracking problems.

### **Summary**
- **BFS** is generally better for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs and level-order traversals.
- **DFS** is generally better for exploring deep structures, backtracking problems, and when space is limited in wide but shallow graphs.
