# Tower of Hanoi
The **Tower of Hanoi** is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a set of discs from one rod to another, following specific rules. The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883.

### **Puzzle Setup**
- **Rods:** There are three rods, usually labeled as A, B, and C.
- **Discs:** There are multiple discs of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The discs are initially stacked on one rod (usually rod A) in ascending order of size, with the largest disc at the bottom and the smallest at the top.

### **Objective**
The goal is to move the entire stack of discs from the starting rod (A) to the target rod (C), using the intermediate rod (B) as necessary.

### **Rules**
1. **Only one disc can be moved at a time.**
2. **A disc can only be placed on top of a larger disc or an empty rod.** (i.e., a smaller disc cannot be placed on top of a larger one).

### **Solution Strategy: Recursive Approach**
The Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved using a recursive algorithm. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

#### **Steps to Solve for n Discs:**
1. **Move the top n-1 discs** from rod A to rod B using rod C as an auxiliary.
2. **Move the nth (largest) disc** directly from rod A to rod C.
3. **Move the n-1 discs** from rod B to rod C using rod A as an auxiliary.

This process is repeated recursively until the entire stack is moved.

### **Example with 3 Discs:**
Let's walk through the solution for 3 discs (A, B, and C are the rods):

1. **Move disc 1** from A to C.
2. **Move disc 2** from A to B.
3. **Move disc 1** from C to B.
4. **Move disc 3** from A to C.
5. **Move disc 1** from B to A.
6. **Move disc 2** from B to C.
7. **Move disc 1** from A to C.

After 7 moves, all discs are moved from rod A to rod C, following the rules.

# Solving Reccurance
The recurrence relation for the Tower of Hanoi problem can be expressed as:

$T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1$

#### **Steps to Solve for \( n \) Discs:**

1. **Move the top \( n-1 \) discs** from the source rod (A) to the auxiliary rod (B), using the destination rod (C) as an intermediate.
   - This step involves solving a smaller instance of the same problem with \( n-1 \) discs.
   - The minimum number of moves required for this step is \( T(n-1) \).

2. **Move the largest disc (the \( n \)th disc)** directly from the source rod (A) to the destination rod (C).
   - This is a single move, so it adds 1 to the total count.

3. **Move the \( n-1 \) discs** from the auxiliary rod (B) to the destination rod (C), using the source rod (A) as an intermediate.
   - This again involves solving the same problem with \( n-1 \) discs, requiring \( T(n-1) \) moves.

Adding these steps together gives us the total number of moves:

$T(n) = T(n-1) + 1 + T(n-1)$

Simplifying this expression:

$T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1$


1. **Start with the given relation:**

   $T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1$

2. **Substitute the expression for \( T(n-1) \):**

   $T(n-1) = 2T(n-2) + 1$

   Substituting this into the original equation:

   $T(n) = 2(2T(n-2) + 1) + 1 = 4T(n-2) + 2 + 1 = 4T(n-2) + 3$

3. **Continue unrolling:**

   Substitute \( T(n-2) \):

   $T(n-2) = 2T(n-3) + 1$

   Substituting into the expression for \( T(n) \):

   $T(n) = 4(2T(n-3) + 1) + 3 = 8T(n-3) + 4 + 3 = 8T(n-3) + 7$

4. **Generalize the pattern:**

   By continuing this process, we observe a pattern. After unrolling the recurrence \( k \) times, we get:

   $T(n) = 2^k T(n-k) + (2^k - 1)$

5. **Base case:**

   We know from the problem that \( T(1) = 1 \) (for one disc, only one move is required).

   When \( k = n-1 \), we reach the base case:

   $T(n) = 2^{n-1} T(1) + (2^{n-1} - 1)$

   Substituting \( T(1) = 1 \):

   $T(n) = 2^{n-1} \times 1 + (2^{n-1} - 1)$

   Simplifying further:

   $T(n) = 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 1 = 2 \times 2^{n-1} - 1 = 2^n - 1$

### **Closed-form Solution**
The closed-form solution for the recurrence relation is:

$T(n) = 2^n - 1$

This formula gives the minimum number of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for \( n \) discsp.
